# Dymaxion Labs Toolkit Charter

This Charter states the project’s mission, scope, principles and contribution guidelines to help our community understand how it all fits together. 

## Mission

The **Dymaxion Labs Toolkit** is a collection of open source libraries that leverage AI and Computer Vision to understand the physical world, by analyzing large scale geospatial data. The Toolkit removes the barriers to geospatial deep learning, providing easy to use tools and a standardized workflow.  

## Scope

The Dymaxion Labs Toolkit Project (the “Project”) develops software under an open source license, supporting the geospatial deep learning lifecycle with tools for data pre-processing, neural network training and prediction, and post-processing to turn model results into standard geospatial formats. Currently the toolkit does not cover data acquisition (i.e. downloading satellite imagery for a given area of interest). 

## Values

When we talk about our culture, we talk about the way we interact with each other, every single day, at the office or remotely. We have two non-negotiable values: cooperation and execution. Cooperation means to be always ready to help your teammates; Execution means to have always-on the ability to deliver to our stakeholders.

We love transparency and hard fact evidence, and we are committed to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. As active open source developers, we produce source code, blueprints, and documentation that are freely available to the public.

## Contributing

Participation in the Project through interaction with our code repositories is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter. Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at the [issues page](https://github.com/dymaxionlabs/toolkit/issues). This Project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant code of conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).
